# bootium

The CSS and JavaScript framework that helps you build modern websites in Medium's style

## Why

:yum:

[Medium](https://medium.com/) is somewhere we can really draw inspiration, and I did make a [website](http://insekai.com/) that looks like Medium but with some extra updates from me.

More than above, I can learn how to design by studying Medium's UI. The problem is I used to rewrite these Medium-like CSS over and over again, it is time for me to build a kit to help preventing from that crap. Also inspired by the name of Bootstrap, I shall call this project Bootium, sounds bad but has a good meaning.
